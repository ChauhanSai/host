# Random Colors
Random Colors is a website that generates and displays random colors to use in any project.

## Using the website
### Web
This tool can be found hosted via [GitHub Pages below](https://chauhansai.github.io/Script-Projects/HTML/randomColors/randomColors.html). This is the best way to access the tool and generate colors. The generator provides you with the hex and RGB values for you to copy and use in any circumstance. To generate a new color, refresh the page or click on the previous hex or RGB value.
