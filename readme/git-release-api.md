## Using the script
### Using gitReleaseDownloads.py

```python
>>>  import gitReleaseDownloads
>>>  
>>>  total = 0
>>>  
>>>  total = gitReleaseDownloads.countDownloads("ChauhanSai/Plasticator-Texture-Pack", total)
>>>  total = gitReleaseDownloads.countDownloads("ChauhanSai/Cape-Pack", total)
```
